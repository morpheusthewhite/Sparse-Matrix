# Sparse-Matrix
A very efficient implementation of sparse matrix (Matrix with a great percent of 0s) in C using Linked Lists


In Sparse_Matrix functions you can find standard matrices operations: allocation, deletion, sum, multiplication and so on.

In Sparse_Matrix there is a main.c for testing these operations, already compiled in mat_sparsa_lista using gcc 6.3.0;
You'll also find a random sparse matrix generator, ran_mat.c, compiled in the same way of main.c into ran_mat (it just produces a random output into mat.dat, to modify mat2.dat you'll have to rename its result).
